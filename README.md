# 🌟 Mall Project OpenGL 🌟
🔍 The Mall Project OpenGL is a comprehensive application that utilizes OpenGL for rendering 3D scenes. The project is designed to demonstrate the capabilities of OpenGL and provide a foundation for further development. It includes features such as scene rendering, input handling, and GUI management using ImGui. The application is built using C++ and utilizes various libraries, including GLFW, GLM, and spdlog.

## 🚀 Features
- **Scene Rendering**: The application can render 3D scenes using OpenGL, including drawing objects and managing the rendering pipeline.
- **Input Handling**: The application can handle input events, such as keyboard and mouse input, and provide methods for toggling fullscreen mode and setting the window's size.
- **GUI Management**: The application uses ImGui for GUI management, providing methods for rendering GUI elements, such as input fields, sliders, and buttons.
- **Debugging**: The application includes debugging features, such as the ability to render GUI elements for debugging and user input.
